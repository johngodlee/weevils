Genetic variation of *Pinus pinaster* Ait. seedlings in susceptibility
to the pine weevil Hylobius abietis L.

Zas *et al.*, 2005

-   P. pinaster is the Maritime Pine, native to Western and
    Southwestern Med.

-   fertilisation x progeny test

-   To determine genetic variation between families and the possibility
    to quantify resistance

-   strong correlations among wounds and average seedling colour. Could
    use this as a proxy for quick screening for weevil damage.

-   Positive correlation between diameter growth and weevil damage

-   Faster growing families attacked more,

-   \[15,16,18,19,36\]

-   Changes in soil fertility, water, light regime have an effect on the
    phenotype

    -   Affects the allocation of resources

-   \[10,32\] examples of how genotype (not phenotype) can be affected
    by environment

-   Adult pine weevils feed on the bark of young seedlings causing
    growth losses, stem deformation, increased mortality

-   \[2\] for example of the use of genetic resistance in forestry

-   Sampling

    -   \[51\] for importance of equal damage across the area

    -   28 ‘plus' trees randomly selected in a first generation seed
        orchard

    -   **What is a Plus Tree? A phenotypically superior specimen**

    -   8 fertilisation treatments and an unfertilised control
        (fertilised mean has had fertiliser applied)

    -   Randomised split plot design replicated in 10 blocks

        -   Split plot used when a factor that is to be studied cannot
            change as often as other factors over space/time due to
            constraints like land availibility.

        -   apply your treatment to a large area then subdivide the area
            for each seed variety

        -   accounts for lack of ability to fully randomise the factor

        -   e.g. keep the oven hot for the first 8 cakes then cold for
            the next 8 cakes

    -   Total height and ground line diameter measured one year after
        plantation

    -   Evaluating the wounds in the stem caused by the insect

    -   Stem height divided into 10 parts of equal length, each zone had
        its wounds evaluated on a 4-level scale

        -   No damage,

        -   Some wounds

        -   Many wounds

        -   Death due to girdling

    -   expressed as the sum of the ten values expressed as a percentage

    -   Leader (main stem) loss due to stem girdling was recorded as a %
        of the total height using a 6 level scale 0-20-40-60-80-100%

    -   Wounding was reliable but hard to assess, also measured

        -   Foliage colour

        -   Foliage density

        -   amount of resin in the stem

        -   All were assessed on a scale from 1 (Yellow, low,
            much resin) to 4 (green, no loss of needles, no resin)

    -   Analysed by a general linear model

-   Found that the wounding measures were too hardy to assess properly
    in an operational breeding setting

-   The symptom trait was easier to assess and strongly genetically
    correlated with the wounding measure

-   Diameter growth and Weevil damage were phenotypically and
    genetically positively correlated.

-   Colour score correlated @ r^2^=0.75, P&lt;0.001

Fertilization increases Hylobius abietis L. damage in Pinus pinaster
Ait. seedlings

Zas *et al.*, 2006

-   Same as the above experiment but added some bits

-   Geostatistics to assess whether the damage was homogenous over the
    study area. Is there a pattern not explained by the block design?

-   Used a semivariogram

-   $y\left( h \right) = \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\lbrack z\left( s_{i} \right) - z\left( s_{i + h} \right)\rbrack^{2}}$

    -   n=number of observational pairs

    -   h=distance between pairs

    -   si=value of variable at location i

    -   z(si+h)=Value in an observation at *h* distance from si

Effects of green tree retention, prescribed burning and soil treatment
on pine weevil (*Hylobius abietis* and *Hylobius pinastri*) damage to
planted Scots pine seedlings

Pitkanen *et al.*, 2005

-   Severity of feeding damage classified as:

    -   0=no damage, no more than one spot-like scar

    -   1= &lt;25%

    -   2=25-50% girth of the seedling gnawed

    -   3=feeding scar extending &gt;50% of girth

    -   4=seedling completely girdled

-   Also measured lengths of the seedlings

-   1+2 classes turned out to be of little impact on survival and so
    were combined in analysis

Abundance of Pine Weevils (*Hylobius abietis*) and damage to conifer
seedlings in relation to Silvicultural practices

Sydow, 1997

-   Presence of feeding damage was recorded,

-   Dead seedlings were uprooted and examined closely in order to
    determine cause of death.‑

Managing the Pine Weevil on Lowland Pine

Wainhouse *et al.*, 2007

-   Transects within which all trees sampled/ randomly selected

-   Trees that have died from other causes, i.e. branch snapping or
    herbivory by mammals should be excluded

-   Feeding is differentiated into that which penetrates down into the
    xylem on at least some of the feeding area and that which is
    superficial

    -   Those that penetrate down to xylem are susceptible and are
        likely to be girdled in the future

-   Resin at the site of attack is seen as a resistance response

-
