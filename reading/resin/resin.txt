# Holopainen et al. 2009 - Potential for the Use of Exogenous Chemical Elicitors in Disease and Insect Pest Management of Conifer Seedling Production

Terpenes are used by conifers to deter attacks from insect herbivores and are found in oleoresin in the bark and needles of conifer trees.


# Whitehill et al. 2018 - Functions of stone cells and oleoresin terpenes in the conifer defense syndrome

Chemical defenses include the accumulation of terpenoids and phenolics (Franceschi et al., 2005; Keeling & Bohlmann, 2006; Raffa, 2014)

Terpene rich oleoresin functions as both a physical and chemical defense. 

Oleoresin is constitutively produced and ccumulates in spruce stems mostly in cortical resin ducts and in radial resin ducts that reach from the cortex into the Xylem (Franceschi et al., 2005; Celedon et al., 2017).

Additional oleoresin terpene biosynthesis is induced by wounding (Franceschi et al., 2000; Martin et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2005; Zulak et al., 2010).

Physical defenses include bark texture and thickness, calcium oxalate crystals, and stone cells (sclereids) (Franceschi et al., 2005; King et al., 2011; Whitehill et al., 2016a,b).

In Canada, naturally occurring genotypes have been identified as weevil-resistant (R) and weevil-susceptible (S). The R varieties are found in an area that has historically had more weevils present (King and Alfaro 2009, Robert et al. 2010).

Weevils in R trees showed delayed ovary development and reduced reproductive success (Robert & Bohlmann 2010).

Stone cells appear to hinder the establishment of neonate larvae and slow larval development, even in the absence of oleoresin.
