@article{Leather1999,
	Abstract = {The biology and pest status of Hylobius abietis Linnaeus in Europe are critically reviewed. New data are presented and the relationships between the weevil and its host plants considered. In Europe, H. abietis is the major pest of establishment forestry causing millions of ECUs of damage annually and perpetuating the addition of insecticide residues to sensitive habitats. Predator and parasitoid complexes in Britain and Europe are compared and contrasted. The lack of knowledge of the processes involved in adult dispersal and longevity are highlighted as major areas of concern. The biology and behaviour of the adult and larval stages are reviewed and new data presented. The feeding preferences of the adult weevils are considered and the possibility of using deterrents as a pest management strategy discussed. The development of risk assessment and forecasting tools aimed at more effective deployment of pest-management options are discussed. Risk criteria have their origins in important ecological relationships which require new understanding, but the prospects for determining highrisk forest sites are promising. The options for biological control are evaluated, in particular the use of mycopesticides and increased larval predation. It is concluded that much more research into the biology and ecology of H. abietis is required before a successful Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programme can be initiated.},

@article{Nordlander2009,
	Abstract = {1 A new method for the physical protection of conifer seedlings against feeding damage by Hylobius abietis (L.), is described and evaluated in field trials in Swedish forest plantations.  2 The lower 60\% of the stem of the seedling is protected by the Conniflex coating, consisting of fine sand (grain size = 0.2 mm) embedded in an acrylate dispersion that remains flexible after drying.  3 Seedlings are treated in the nursery by a large-scale application procedure involving four steps: (i) spraying the seedlings with water; (ii) application of fixative to the lower sections of the stems, (iii) application of fine sand to the fixative; and (iv) drying of the fixative.  4 A field experiment over three seasons demonstrated a significant increase in survival for coated seedlings compared with untreated seedlings. The survival rate increased from 29\% to 97\% for Scots pine and from 26\% to 86\% for Norway spruce. Coating the lower 30\% of the stem (instead of 60\%) provided inferior protection, resulting in only 64\% survival in spruce.  5 Field trials in 11 commercial plantation areas indicated that the Conniflex sand coating was as effective in protecting seedlings as treatment with the insecticide imidacloprid.  6 The new method of coating conifer seedlings with fine sand provides an effective and environmentally sound alternative to insecticide treatment.},

@article{Zas2005,
	Abstract = {Fifteen-year results from a study initiated in 1992 to compare the effectiveness of repeated cutting treatments with treatments involving single cutting or a single application of glyphosate herbicide are presented. While treatments resulted in significant improvements in diameter and height of planted spruce at ages 3 to 7, these differences were no longer significant in year 15. All vegetation control treatments significantly increased survival in year 15 but did not significantly affect average spruce size. Despite apparent initial treatment effects on vegetation cover, the treatments applied in this study have had little lasting effect on non-crop vegetation.},
